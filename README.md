# Boost_uBLAS_GSoC18
Programming competency test

Implement a small library in C++ using expression templates and modern C++11/14/17 features like generic lambdas to:

 - represent a matrix of numerical types (int, long, float, double, complex,....)
 - compute algebraic expressions including + and *, += and *=. Matrix multiplication can be implemented with the most simple algorithm
 - fit in one header file
 - provides a test program which can measure its speed of execution for each examples provided
